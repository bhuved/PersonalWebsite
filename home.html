                    Throughout my career, I have cultivated strong technical abilities in 
                    software development and problem-solving. Currently enrolled C# .NET Bootcamp at Grand Circus, where 
                    I have gained hands-on experience building and deploying applications .
                    I am consistently excelling in assessments and projects. 
                    I recently completed a mid-term project where I collaborated with peers to build a console-based 
                    Library Terminal application, leveraging my skills in C#, LINQ, and file I/O. 
                    I am now focused on advancing my skills in web development using ASP.NET Core, MVC, Razor Pages,
                    HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.

                    In addition to my software engineering skills, my experience as an Operation Specialist at 
                    United Wholesale Mortgage has helped me develop a strong attention to detail and a proactive approach 
                    to problem-solving. My role involved reviewing critical documents and ensuring data accuracy,
                     where I excelled in meeting daily goals and collaborating cross-functionally to resolve issues. 
                     This experience, combined with my previous roles as a Senior Software Engineer at Virtusa and Satyam,
                     has honed my ability to work under pressure, meet deadlines, and deliver quality results in high-stakes
                     environments.

                <p class="text-small">When I am not working, I love watching soccer games, painting, singing and roaming with my family
                    at my Home town, Troy, MI.
